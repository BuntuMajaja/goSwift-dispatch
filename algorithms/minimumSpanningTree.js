/*
* minimum spanning tree (MST) best implementation to solve this problem
* kruskal algorithm or prims algorithm. calculating the cost is the main challenge
* constraints = tree must not be more than 3 nodes, cost of whole span not greater
* than cost of sum(individual spans) * 1.4?
*
* Should possibly use a set of trees (i.e. forest) instead of a single tree
* given N nodes, the should be N-1 edges at most we must be able to get from one Node to any
* other Node in the set of trees. We must be able to span at most 3 edges that represent trips.
* Should all nodes be disjointed (including edges to connect another trip, then we should span node+2)
*
* Assumptions :-
* - there is a car always at each trip vertex
* - not more than 3 real paths (actual trips) to be included
* - cost of whole span not greater than
* - factor the cars used as a factor (e.g. 3 trips * 3 cars vs 3 trips * 1 car)
* - determine the factor by which the total span including the joints may exceed
* - the sum of the trips.
* -
* This algorithm uses Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm to determine
*  given a set of GPS points representing passenger trips (both departure and arrival points),
* the routes with the least distance between 2 or 3 passengers who are travelling in more or less same
* direction
*
* @
* @params riders_depart_xy, passenger departure locations[] in x,y
* @params riders_arrive_xy, passenger arrival locations[] in x,y
* @params size, number of passengers
* @params distance, cost = distance (assumption - we ignore other costs like time, money etc)
* @params time_window

/**
Algorithm strategies
- take the longest trip by distance. calculate its bearing. iterate through all other trips
 with a similar bearing with a minimum deviation

- define the maximum deviation from trip route allowable for 2nd and 3rd pickup
- define maximum total cost in distance allowable to combine 2 or 3 individual trips
- ensure that the cost of the total trip in fares still make sense (i.e. its less than
the users taking own individual trips)
