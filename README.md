# goSwift-dispatch
This is a real-time service (think Uber dispatch) to handle the dispatching of taxis to passengers

Dispatch is meant to handle all the real-time requests such as:-

- Real-time taxi requests by passengers using mobile applications 
- logs GPS location of each driver in real-time
- logs GPS location of passengers in real-time 
- Real-time trip data logging 
- matching drivers and passengers (demand/supply matching)
- car-pooling passengers based on time-window, departure, destination, price
